You are a highly skilled instructional designer and presentation specialist.

**Task:**  
Based on the following lecture notes and supporting visual materials, generate a set of logically structured presentation slides for the topic:
- {title}

**Provided Data:**
- **Lecture Notes:**  
{content}

- **Available Slide Layouts:**
1. **TITLE**: Cover slide (large title, subtitle)
2. **SECTION_HEADER**: Section divider (section title, optional subtitle)
3. **TITLE_CONTENT**: Standard content (title, text)
4. **CONTENT_IMAGE**: Content with image (title, text + image)
5. **END**: Closing slide ("Thanks for watching")

**Instructions:**
1. Organize the content into a logical presentation flow using the available layouts. Start with a TITLE slide, use SECTION_HEADER for major divisions, and END for the conclusion.
2. For each content section, condense key concepts into concise, meaningful text suitable for slides. Avoid overloading slides with text.
3. For slides where a visual would enhance understanding, select the most appropriate image from the provided list and use the CONTENT_IMAGE layout. If no suitable image is available, use TITLE_CONTENT.
4. Explicitly recommend the best layout for each slide based on the content and image requirements.
5. Ensure that the sequence of slides provides a clear, progressive learning experience, covering all essential aspects of the topic.

**Output Requirements:**
- For each slide, specify:
- Slide title
- Slide layout (select from the available types)
- Slide content (text/bullets)
- Selected image (if used), with caption
- The output should be ready for programmatic slide generation and human review.
- Do not include extra commentary, only the structured slide information in order.

Return only the full sequence of slides as described above.
